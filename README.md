 Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Pre-trained Models
What is Transfer Learning?
Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is particularly useful when the second task has limited data. Rather than training a model from scratch, we leverage the learned features of a pre-trained model.

Why Use Transfer Learning?
Faster Training: Saves computational resources since the model has already learned general features.

Better Performance: Pre-trained models are trained on large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet), which helps them extract useful low-level and mid-level features.

Effective for Small Datasets: Especially beneficial when the new task has a limited number of training samples.

Pre-trained Models
Popular pre-trained models include:

VGG16/VGG19

ResNet50

InceptionV3

MobileNet

EfficientNet

These models are typically trained on large datasets like ImageNet.

Fine-Tuning: Adapting a Pre-trained Model
Fine-tuning involves:

Loading a Pre-trained Model: Use a model trained on a large dataset.

Freezing Base Layers: Initially prevent updates to the weights of the lower layers to retain learned features.

Replacing the Top Layers: Modify or add new dense layers according to the new task (e.g., change output layer for binary classification).

Training the Modified Model: Train the new top layers (and optionally some unfrozen base layers) on the target dataset with appropriate hyperparameters.

Key Steps in Implementation
Load the pre-trained model (excluding its top classification layer)

Add custom fully connected layers suitable for the target task

Compile the model with a suitable loss function and optimizer

Train and validate on the new dataset

Common Hyperparameters to Optimize

Choice of Optimizer (SGD, Adam, etc.)

Applications
Transfer learning is widely used in:

Image classification

Object detection

Natural Language Processing (with models like BERT, GPT)

Medical image analysis
